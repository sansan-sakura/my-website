    "I am x-french pastry baker who loves to create something new/ beautiful/ creative. I started learning programming in 2022 when I had the second boy because I wanted to be more flexible about where and when I work. At that time we were in Germany, where I had no one to ask for help, so I had to take care of my children and could not do any work. Nevertheless, I really wanted to work and contribute to society.So my decision was: computer programming!I am now part of a boot camp at technigo in Sweden, where we have moved to this year. We live in a town in northern Sweden and enjoy the wild and rough nature with two boys. They love Swedish nature, picking berries and mushrooms, fishing, walking and camping.I love programming, problem solving, looking at somebody's code to see how it could be done in a different way, thinking about performance and of course learning more and more about programming and new technologies. I find programming very creative and attractive because it grows so fast, you never get bored! I am also interested in UX/UI and would like to learn more about web design soon.",
