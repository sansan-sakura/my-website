  long: "I am a junior front-end developer with a unique background as a former French pastry chef.

    "My journey is nothing short of inspiring. Starting as a French pastry chef, I reveled in creating both beautiful and delectable masterpieces, delighting others with your culinary expertise. However, the demands of parenthood and a move abroad led me to seek a new path. I undertook the challenge of learning programming, a pursuit fueled by my fondness for mathematics in my teenage years. Through diligent self-study, I gained proficiency in essential tools and frameworks: JavaScript, React, CSS/SCSS, Next.js, and Astro. This culminated in a decision to further refine my skills at Technigo's coding Bootcamp, scheduled for autumn 2023. My goal is crystal clear: to craft code that's not just functional, but exemplary in its cleanliness and robustness. My passion extends beyond practical applications; I am eager to dive deep into the realms of computer science, embracing the vastness of the technological landscape. In my leisure time,I immerse myself in building small applications to fortify my skills, leveraging resources like Udemy, Coursera, and YouTube for continuous learning. Beyond the screen, I find solace in the outdoors, engaging in activities like berry and mushroom picking, fishing, and hiking with my family. A unique aspect of my interests lies in playing the shakuhachi, a traditional Japanese flute, which I've been playing since I was about 7 years old with my grand-father.",
